# bump.lua simple demo

This is the simple demo of [bump.lua](http://github.com/kikito/bump.lua)

It requires [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org) to work properly.

This simple demo creates a world populated by random boxes, and allows to move a player around using the keyboard arrow keys. The player has constant velocity
and can will "slide" over the boxes without penetrating them, similarly to some classic games such as Zelda.

Pressing TAB will display some debug information.
